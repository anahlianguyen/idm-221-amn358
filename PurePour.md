# Case Study: PurePour
A multimedia product that allows users to check how clean their water is as well as get notified when to replace the filter. The company is held accountable for being reliant by allowing users to view their water quality. The app also allows users to buy filters and products straight from the app in order to make it easier for users to replace their filters.

**Tools**: FIGMA / Illustrator / Photoshop / Procreate

**Timeline**: 1 month

**Role**: Product Designer / UX Researcher / UI Designer

**Date Completed**: November 2023

## Features

### Connectivity & Overview
Users are able to control their devices from one screen and shows the amount of battery as well as connecting with different deviopces to get the individual information of each water bottle.

### Online Ordering in App
Gives the users an opportunity to replace their filter straight from the app after having received a notification to replace the filter.

### Transparency with Users
Gives the users an opportunity to replace their filter straight from the app after having received a notification to replace the filter.

# 01. User Research

## User Interviews
I interviewed 8 participants with the goal of understanding their **water usage** & what their relationship is with tap water. My focus was to identify what the key aspects are that would make the water filter an **easy & simple experience.**

## Surveys 
I sent out surveys to random college students in order to gather more information on their water filtration uses and their current experience with competitors.

## Motivation
* Have clean and safe water
* Maintain good health

## User Pains
* If app is **high maintenance** & doesn’t easily fit into daily routines.

## Goals
* Improve Water Quality
* Easy process for users for filter replacement
* Simple process to maintain healthy water
* Improve people’s health

## Secondary Research
We researched water quality in cities, the types of chemicals the users drink in their tap water, and different types of filters used for water filtration.

# 02. Synthesize

## Insights from Research
My team and I established the **essential design** goals & **key features** based on the research data gathered from my interviews & and their secondary research. These will become my **focus points** when planning the designs for this project.

## Key Features
### Needs
* A form to remind users when to replace filters
* Creating a filtration device that takes little to no time to filter
* Showcasing to users exactly what they are drinking

### Pains
* Having to wait for the water filter to fill up
* Not knowing when to replace the filter
* Odd taste of water occasionally

# 03. Ideating

## 5 Why's Method
Used the 5 why’s method to lock in our main features and to ensure of people’s primary pains with water filtration devices.

## Product Skethces
Used the 5 why’s method to lock in our main features and to ensure of people’s primary pains with water filtration devices.

## Product Sketches
We made 40 different iterations of our Water Bottle & Filter concept. After having recieved feedback on our product sketches, we narrowed down our product to the portable water filter iteration.

# 04. UI Design - Generating Sketches & Prototypes
## Hand Drawn Sketches
I drew the sketches and thought about the flow of the app. Main feature I considered was the water filtration page. I had to think about how to convey the information for users in a way that’s simple and easy.

## Lo-fi Sketches

I blocked all the content and began to organize the frames and the actual flow of the app.

## Final Screens

# 05. Product Design

## 3D Modeling
I made the 3D model based of our sketches. I considered our features which included a portable filter concept and a cooling / heating plate at the bottom.

## Physical Lo-fi Prototype
My team created the physical prototypes in order to view improvements needed for our product design.

# Conclusion
From this project I learned how to collaborate effectively with a team. I also got to create a product and digital interface using the design process and I was able to create a user centric concept that would improve users water quality intake. The most challenging part was narrowing down an issue that we as designers could improve or fix with a mobile and product design.
