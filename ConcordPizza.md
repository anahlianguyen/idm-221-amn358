# Concord Pizza Redesign

A mobile ordering interface redesign for a local pizza shop.

**Tools**: FIGMA / Photoshop

**Timeline**: 10 Weeks

**Role**: Rolo UX/UI Designer

**Date Completed**: February 2024

# Problem
## Homepage
Users have to go to different platforms to find all the information they need. The information is spread out between Facebook, their website, and Foursquare to find store hours, menu, and location.

## No Mobile Ordering
Current website has no menu or ordering system in place.

This creates a negative brand image and users become frustrated which negatively impacts the business and people’s experience.

## Goals
### Boosting Sales with Loyalty
### Effortless Ordering: Crafting a Seamless Mobile Experience
### Balancing Simplicity & Customization
### Navigating Choice: Streamlining Menu Exploration for Users

# Ideation

## Hand Drawn Sketches
I drew sketches of the functionalities I wanted to include and briefly plan the flow before I began on wireframes.

## Wireframes 
I planned out the main 3 screens and how each feature I wanted to provide would be included in the 3 pages (recents / featured / full menu).

## PLanning the Flow
I created a brief chart of the flow for the mobile functionalities such as the express ordering and the flow of the item pop-ups.

# Testing

## Heuristic Evalutation
I tested the prototype on 3 users, and after analyzing the results I decided to focus on 3 main takeaways.

## Takeaways

### Include Help and Feedback
### Include Forms & Data Entry
### Help Users Explore Menu Items

## Easy Ordering and Info Access
Giving the users the functionality to easily remove items and be show customers the ingredient allergens for easy search and decision making. Included is a suggestion section with appetizer items cards as a way to up-sale items.

## Rewards
Gives customers an incentive to come back in order to earn free items. Easy and simple. Scan. Grab. Go.

## Explore
Because of a large selection, the explore page will allow users to narrow down their choices and explore Concord Pizza’s most popular items in one page. It uses compelling titles to entice customers and advertises limited time deals and meals for those looking to explore something new.

## Express Ordering
Using recognition rather than recall, customers are allowed to view past order and favorite them for easy ordering. Gives customers the option to express order or take their time by adding it to cart.
