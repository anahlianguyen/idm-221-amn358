    <h1>PERSONAL</h1>
    <p>Hi! I'm Anahlia, a User Experience and Interaction Design major at Drexel University. My career goals for the future are to work in a city I've never lived before and explore different user needs in different countries. I would also love to work for a company where I would be able to make creative, interactive, and interesting interfaces that work alongside their business.

        Some of my personal hobbies include painting, graphic design, running long distances, and making nail art. In school I am a part of the Asian Student Association, Society of Asian Scientists and Engineers, and Drexel CHI. I love to travel, and I hope to someday be able to travel all 7 continents.
        
        My short term goals at the moment are to find a summer internship relating to User Experience that gives me experience in conducting user research and working alongside design teams, and to learn CSS and HTML before the internship in order to effectively communicate with design teams. Another short term goal is to get involved with more clubs at my school and obtain a position where I can work in a team to make events happen.
        
        I've included more about my experiences in my resume. I hope to be able to work overseas at some point in my life and explore different user needs in different countries.
        </p>
